This enables them to perform well in a variety of applications, as shown in previous modules. It is not uncommon though to find situations where applying a general purpose model performs unacceptably for specific dataset or use case. This often does not mean that the general purpose model is unusable. Perhaps, with some new data and additional training the model could be improved, or fine-tuned, such that it produces acceptable results for the specific use case.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/YanSte/NLP-LLM-Fine-tuning-Trainer/blob/main/img_1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">\n\nFine-tuning uses a pre-trained model as a base and continues to train it with a new, task targeted dataset.

The training process remains a resource intensive, and time consuming effort. Albeit fine-tuning training time is greatly shortened as a result of having started from a pre-trained model. \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/YanSte/NLP-LLM-Fine-tuning-Trainer/blob/main/img_3.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Here some definitions:**\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n<details>\n  <summary style=\"list-style: none;\"><b>▶️ Llame 2 Model?</b></summary>\n  <br/>\n  <img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/08/shutterstock_1871547451-100945157-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">\n  <br/>\n  Llama 2 is a family of pre-trained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) developed by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.

Instead of using high-precision data types, such as 32-bit floating-point numbers, quantization represents values using lower-precision data types, such as 8-bit integers. This process significantly reduces memory usage and can speed up model execution while maintaining acceptable accuracy.\n    \n  The basic idea behind quantization is quite easy: going from high-precision representation (usually the regular 32-bit floating-point) for weights and activations to a lower precision data type. The most common lower precision data types are:\n\n  - float16, accumulation data type float16\n  - bfloat16, accumulation data type float32. It’s similar to the standard 32-bit floating-point format but uses fewer bits, so it takes up less space in computer memory.\n  - int16, accumulation data type int32\n  - int8, accumulation data type int32\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n<details>\n  <summary style=\"list-style: none;\"><b>▶️ 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)?</b></summary>\n  <br/>\n\nNF4, a 4-bit Normal Float, is tailor-made for AI tasks, specifically optimizing neural network weight quantization.

The binary conversion of numbers varies based on the datatype, affecting precision and range. For example, FP32, commonly used in Deep Learning, can represent numbers between ±1.18×10^-38 and ±3.4×10³⁸. On the other hand, NF4 has a range of [-8, 7].\n\nQLoRA employs brainfloat16 (bfloat16), developed by Google for high-throughput floating-point operations in machine learning and computational tasks.\n\n  <br/>\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n<details>\n  <summary style=\"list-style: none;\"><b>▶️ Bitsandbytes?</b></summary>\n\n  Make the process of model quantization more accessible.

It is widely used for its reduced memory footprint but can be sensitive to numerical issues due to its limited dynamic range.\n- **Float32 (Single-Precision):** With 32 bits, float32 includes 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 bits for the mantissa. It provides a larger dynamic range and higher precision than float16 but consumes more memory.\n- **Bfloat16:** Specifically designed for deep learning, bfloat16 uses 16 bits, allocating 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 7 bits for the mantissa. Its dynamic range is closer to float32, making it suitable for maintaining precision while reducing memory usage during training.\n    \n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*VskW_nvXmtV3VAsq1YuqCQ.png\" alt=\"Learning\" width=\"50%\">\n    \n**Bfloat16:**\n- 16-bit floating point format tailored for deep learning applications.\n- Comprises one sign bit, eight exponent bits, and seven mantissa bits.\n- Demonstrates a larger dynamic range (number of exponent bits) than float16, aligning closely with float32.\n- Efficiently handles exponent changes, potentially leading to memory savings.\n- Offers improved training efficiency, reduced memory usage, and space savings.\n- Less susceptible to underflows, overflows, or numerical instability during training.\n\n**Float16/32:**\n- Float16: IEEE half-precision, Float32: IEEE single-precision.\n- Exhibits a smaller dynamic range compared to bfloat16.\n- May encounter numerical issues such as overflows or underflows during training.\n- Loss scaling might be necessary in mixed precision settings to mitigate side effects.\n- Float32 generally requires more memory for storage compared to bfloat16.\n- Training behavior may be less stable, particularly with pure float32 dtype.\n\n**GPU Dependency:**\n- The effectiveness of bfloat16 and float16/32 is contingent on the GPU architecture.\n- Some GPUs offer native support for bfloat16, optimizing its performance benefits.\n- It is crucial to check GPU specifications and compatibility before choosing between bfloat16 and float16/32.\n- Users may need to tailor configurations based on GPU capabilities for optimal results.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile bfloat16 presents advantages in training efficiency and memory usage, its performance is influenced by GPU architecture. Understanding the characteristics of float16, float32, and bfloat16 is crucial for selecting the optimal format based on both task requirements and GPU capabilities.\n\n**How to Enable Bfloat16:**\nTo enable bfloat16 in mixed precision mode, specific changes in the configuration file are necessary, including setting ```model.use_bfloat16``` to True, ```optimizer.loss_scaling_factor``` to 1.0, and model.mixed_precision to True.

Unlike traditional language models that process a continuous string of text, LLMs designed for chat scenarios engage in multi-turn conversations. These conversations consist of multiple messages, each assigned a specific role such as \"user\" or \"assistant,\" accompanied by corresponding message text.\n\nDue to the diverse expectations of various models regarding input formats for chat interactions, the concept of chat templates has emerged as a crucial feature. These templates, integrated into the tokenizer, serve to guide the transformation of conversations—represented as lists of messages—into a unified tokenizable string, aligning with the specific format expected by the model.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, let's delve into a practical example using the BlenderBot model. BlenderBot employs a straightforward default template, primarily introducing whitespace between rounds of dialogue. The integration of chat templates facilitates this process:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill\")\n\nchat = [\n   {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"},\n   {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I'm doing great. How can I help you today?\"},\n   {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I'd like to show off how chat templating works!\"},\n]\n\ntokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False)\n\" Hello, how are you?  I'm doing great. How can I help you today?   I'd like to show off how chat templating works!</s>\"\n```\n\n**References:**\n\n[OpenAI introduced Chat Markup Language (ChatML) based input to non-chat modes](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/openai-introduced-chat-markup-language-chatml-based-input-to-non-chat-modes-6ca4b267012f)\n\n[Microsoft Docs - Chat Markup Language](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/ai-services/openai/includes/chat-markup-language.md)\n\n[Implementing Few-Shot Learning with GPT](https://developer.dataiku.com/latest/tutorials/machine-learning/genai/nlp/gpt-few-shot-clf/index.html#implementing-few-shot-learning)\n\n[Prompting Guide - Few-Shot Learning](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot)\n\n[Learn Prompting - Few-Shot Basics](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot)\n\n[The Science of Control: How Temperature, Top-p, and Top-k Shape Large Language Models](https://medium.com/@daniel.puenteviejo/the-science-of-control-how-temperature-top-p-and-top-k-shape-large-language-models-853cb0480dae)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print_sep()\npretty(alpaca_dataset[:20][\"messages\"][0][0])\nprint_sep()\nprint(\"User:\")\npretty(alpaca_dataset[:20][\"messages\"][0][1])\nprint_sep()\npretty(alpaca_dataset[:20][\"messages\"][0][2])\nprint_sep()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-26T12:10:20.395502Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-26T12:10:20.395812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-26T12:10:20.409298Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-26T12:10:20.395787Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-26T12:10:20.408262Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"##############\ncontent: You are an AI who answering question.

Phonics-based instruction: This approach focuses on teaching children how to decode words by sounding out letters and syllables. It is a comprehensive method that helps children understand the relationship between sounds and letters, making it easier for them to recognize and spell words.\n2. Whole language approach: This strategy emphasizes a holistic approach to reading, focusing on the meaning of text rather than individual letter sounds. Teachers use engaging stories and activities to help students connect with the material and develop a love for reading.\n3. Balanced literacy: This approach combines both phonics-based instruction and whole language techniques. Teachers use a variety of methods to teach reading, including phonics, sight word recognition, and comprehension skills. By using multiple approaches, teachers can reach different types of learners and help students become more confident readers.\n4. Reading aloud together: Sharing books with young children and reading aloud together can be an effective way to introduce them to reading. This strategy allows children to hear the rhythm and cadence of language, as well as build their vocabulary and comprehension skills.\n\nUser: What are some tips for improving my public speaking skills?\nAssistant: Improving Public Speaking Skills: Tips and Strategies\n1. Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice, the more comfortable and confident you will feel when speaking in front of an audience. Try practicing in small groups or alone in front of a mirror.\n2. Prepare thoroughly: Research your topic and organize your thoughts before giving a speech. Make sure you have all the necessary materials, such as notes and visual aids, ready ahead of time.\n3. Focus on your message: Instead of worrying about your nervousness, focus on the message you want to convey to your audience. Remember, you're speaking to share information or inspire, not just to impress.\n4. Use positive self-talk: Before and during your presentation, try to replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations. Remind yourself that you are prepared and capable of delivering a great speech.\n5. Engage with your audience: Make eye contact, vary your tone of voice, and use body language to connect with your listen\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#%%bash\n# model=$PWD/{args.output_dir} # path to model\n#model=$(pwd)/Model_fine_tuned # path to model\n#num_shard=1             # number of shards\n#max_input_length=1024   # max input length\n#max_total_tokens=2048   # max total tokens\n\n#docker run -d --name tgi --gpus all -ti -p 8080:80 \\\n#  -e MODEL_ID=/workspace \\\n#  -e NUM_SHARD=$num_shard \\\n#  -e MAX_INPUT_LENGTH=$max_input_length \\\n#  -e MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS=$max_total_tokens \\\n#  -v $model:/workspace \\\n#  ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.093849Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.094391Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.094101Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.094125Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#import requests as r\n#from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n#from datasets import load_dataset\n#from random import randint\n\n# Load our test dataset and Tokenizer again\n#tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"code-llama-7b-text-to-sql\")\n#eval_dataset = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files=\"test_dataset.json\", split=\"train\")\n#rand_idx = randint(0, len(eval_dataset))\n\n# generate the same prompt as for the first local test\n#prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(eval_dataset[rand_idx][\"messages\"][:2], tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\n#request= {\"inputs\":prompt,\"parameters\":{\"temperature\":0.2, \"top_p\": 0.95, \"max_new_tokens\": 256}}\n\n# send request to inference server\n#resp = r.post(\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/generate\", json=request)\n\n#output = resp.json()[\"generated_text\"].strip()\n#time_per_token = resp.headers.get(\"x-time-per-token\")\n#time_prompt_tokens = resp.headers.get(\"x-prompt-tokens\")\n\n# Print results\n#print(f\"Query:\\n{eval_dataset[rand_idx]['messages'][1]['content']}\")\n#print(f\"Original Answer:\\n{eval_dataset[rand_idx]['messages'][2]['content']}\")\n#print(f\"Generated Answer:\\n{output}\")\n#print(f\"Latency per token: {time_per_token}ms\")\n#print(f\"Latency prompt encoding: {time_prompt_tokens}ms\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.095895Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.096323Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.096102Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-26T12:49:42.096122Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#!docker stop tgi","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-26T12:44:41.218248Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-26T12:44:41.218670Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-26T12:44:41.218458Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-26T12:44:41.218478Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
